## 📄 About the Project

A simple medical system that checks a patient’s eligibility for discharge based on temperature readings, built using object-oriented programming for clean and reusable design.

## 🧠 Features

- Object-Oriented Design (encapsulation, modularity).
- Input handling for patient temperature data.
- Logic for discharge eligibility based on thresholds.
- Clear class-based structure for extensibility.


## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Language: Java.
- Concepts: OOP (classes, objects, encapsulation)


## 🖥️ Sample Output
Enter patient temperature: 37.2
